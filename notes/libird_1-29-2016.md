# Overall questions:
* What are the overall objectives
	* Site level analysis of data for PA Wilds study
	* Possible regional analysis of bird distributions to follow
		* Who will perform analysis?
			* Is this a PA Audubon thing, or an objective of LEAP
			* Where are there efforts that overlap or complement in LEAP or PA

# Short-term goals (2 weeks to align with February 19 meeting deadline):
* Extract layers / stats of point cloud for pilot areas (subset of PA Wilds)
	* Layers
		* Tree Canopy >15-20m
		* Sub Canopy	10-15
		* Tall Shrub 2-10
		* Short Shrub 0.5-2
	* Possible stats either on full stack, or on height layers (full range TBD)
		* Max Height
		* Density
		* Skewness
		* Mean height
		* Median height
		* Percentages of Points

# Mid Term Todo:
* Processing and gap identification
* PostGIS Server Load of LiDAR data
* W PA IP range
* Test ArcGIS 10.3 postgis connection
* Testing viewing tools
* What stats are we thinking we'll run
* How do we resample LiDAR to match between state inventories
* Contact Doug Newcomb

# Attributes of possible study scope:

## Species:
~30

## Total points:
* 1200 (700+140 PA wilds (North Central) need analyzed in 2016)
	* (PA Audubon plans to analyze with boosted regression trees)
	
## Other possible points:	
* Breeding Bird Atlas (PA Roads)
* Breeding Bird Atlas (OH -- probably also roads)
* Need to research available Ohio points

## Techniques in existing papers:
* Horizontal slices
	* Cluster Analysis (Newcomb et al)
	* Best Subsets Regression (Lesak et al) plus partitioning by guilds
	* ...

## Bird data attributes
* Bird detections by species by point
* Maximum number of detections across season
* Distance bands
	* 0-50m
	* 50-100m
	* >100m (possibly exclude from analysis)
* Singing / non-singing (breeders/non-breeders)
* Detection probability corrected

## Forest Community Rapid Assessment
* 25m radius
* Basal Area

## What we trying to predict
* Individual species
* Guilds
* Diversity of guilds
* Foliage height diversity vs. species diversity

# Other notes:
* 10-50 Tree Canopy 15-20 median (15-20 meters and above typical)
* 5-20 Sub Canopy	10-15 median
* 3-15 Tall Shrub 2-5 median (we can use with 2-10)
* 0.5-10 Short Shrub 1-2 median (typically <2m)

## Audubon definitions
* 0-2 shrub
* 2-10 subcanopy
* > 20 canopy

## Breaks in Forest Community Rapid Assessment data collection:
* 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 35, 50
